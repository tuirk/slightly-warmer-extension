Slightly Warmer is a comment generator that makes the process slightly warmer (hence the name). It uses the OpenAI API in the background and starts from your tone, so what it generates actually sounds like you.

I began with Lovable to get a base UI wrapper quickly and then moved the project to Cursor, turning it into a Chrome Extension written in TypeScript. 

Logo started as a quick hand sketch, prototyped in Figma, and finalized through a prompt in ChatGPT.

For light branding work, some visuals were made in Canva; drawn from daily weather forecasts to carry the ‚Äúslightly warmer‚Äù message indirectly, and a second version framed as a social media post to say it more directly.

This MVP version up here still has:

- a rough UI (I branded it later),
- some flow hiccups that need a few extra clicks,
- and a select-text / right-click function that isn‚Äôt working reliably.

It‚Äôs currently on hold (something else is high priority)

I built Slightly Warmer to make showing up online feel less like an algorithm chore and more like yourself. People are commenting just to stay visible or drive results, but the comments often don‚Äôt add anything, don‚Äôt sound human, and rarely sound like them.

This tool is for when you still want to play the game, but bring a bit of yourself to it anyway.
